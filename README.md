# BG_Removal_App

I developed a full-stack **AI-powered SaaS application** for **background removal**, leveraging **MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN stack)** to create a seamless and efficient platform. The app integrates the **Clipdrop API**, allowing users to easily remove image backgrounds with AI-powered precision.  

To enable monetization, I implemented a **credit-based payment system**, where users can purchase credits via a **secure online payment gateway**. This ensures smooth transactions and enhances the user experience. Authentication and user management are handled through **Clerk**, providing ready-to-use UI components for **registration, login, and profile management**.  

With a **responsive UI/UX**, the platform offers a user-friendly experience, making background removal quick and accessible. The application demonstrates expertise in **full-stack development, API integration, authentication, and payment processing**, delivering a powerful and scalable SaaS solution.
